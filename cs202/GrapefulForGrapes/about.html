				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>Grapeful for grapes was formed when some friends got together and realized that 
				grapes are not appreciated enough. They started meeting monthly while sipping wine and whining about grapes.</p>
				<p>That is when Grapeful for Grapes was formed. They got the idea one week when they may have had a little too
				much wine but it has still proven to be a good idea. Now they meet every week and discuss how to better the world, with grapes.</p>
