					<p>I ordered a shirt from Tee Time Shirts and the shirt was pretty good. I don't normally write reviews 
					but i thought the shirt was good enough to write a review for it. Also I really liked the Tee Times website. It was simple and easy to use.</p>

					<p>The shirt I ordered was perfectly sufficient. It functioned as a shirt and that is all that I wanted so I give an average rating.</p>

					<p>I got the best shirt that I have ever owned from Tee Time Shirts. It is such a great shirt I have not taken it off since I have gotten it.
					I now refuse to wear shirts that are not from Tee Time shirts. I highly reccomend that you order all the shirts from them!!!!</p>
