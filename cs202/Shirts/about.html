				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>Tee Times shirts was founded by a group of graphic design students attending Minneapolis College of Art and Design. It started as a group 
				project for a class. They all liked it so much they decided to build it into a company</p>
				<p>They started out just making t-shirts for various clubs at their college. Their shirts were such good quality that they got a fan base
				They then created a kickstarter which helped them get their business off the ground.</p>

				<h2>Philosophy</h2>
				<p>It is our philosophy that we will make everyone the shirt that they want to a T. If our shirts are not made perfectly to your
				specifications we will replace those shirts and fix what you did not like about the shirt for free.</p>
